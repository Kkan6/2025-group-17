## Ideas Summarised
A 2D side-scrolling single-player platformer where players need to reach the end of each level to complete it. The game character comes equipped with four skills, which players can switch between manually at any time (inspired by Super Princess Peach). Within the levels, players can collect various items that can temporarily enhance or change their skills (inspired by Star Kirby). Players can also collect coins to buy power-ups (see "Deck system" below) or log scores. Additionally, they can get an achievement every time they collect all stars within a level.

The game’s camera follows the character, and randomness are added to enhance the immersive gameplay experience:
- Deck system (like “Slay the Spire”): At the end of a level or at save points, choose or purchase one card from a random draw of three, which boosts the character temporarily (the effect lasts for a certain duration or until the end of the level/save point).
- Final Boss gamble (like “Devil’s Roulette”): When the Boss’s health is reduced to 1/4, a gambling mechanism is triggered; winning the bet cuts the Boss’s health in half, and losing restores the Boss’s health to 1/3. Players can choose gambling or not.

The game difficulty is adjustable, allowing players to select a health cap (1-3 points) to control the level of challenge. Additionally, the difference in difficulty between levels is mainly reflected in the amount of enemies and different mechanisms, including:
1.	Time travelling: Change the scene and item layout with different time, triggered by switchs;
2.	Gravity system: Players can control gravity, moving on the ceiling rather than the ground;
3.	Growing and shrinking: After eating a specific item, the character can shrink to access areas that are normally unreachable.

Optional:
- On tops of jumping, players can also attack;
- Player profile can be saved and shared externally;
- Alter the character's appearance depending on the skills they currently use.

TODO: Have a brief background story to get everything together
