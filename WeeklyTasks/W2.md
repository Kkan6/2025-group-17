## Ideas Summarised
A 2D side-scrolling single-player platformer where players need to reach the end of each level to complete it. The game character comes equipped with four skills, which players can switch between manually at any time (inspired by Super Princess Peach). Within the levels, players can collect various items that can temporarily enhance or change their skills (inspired by Star Kirby). Players can also collect coins to buy power-ups (see "Deck system" below) or log scores. Additionally, they can get an achievement every time they collect all stars within a level.

The game’s camera follows the character, and randomness are added to enhance the immersive gameplay experience:
- Deck system (like “Slay the Spire”): At the end of a level or at save points, choose or purchase one card from a random draw of three, which boosts the character temporarily (the effect lasts for a certain duration or until the end of the level/save point).
- Final Boss gamble (like “Devil’s Roulette”): When the Boss’s health is reduced to 1/4, a gambling mechanism is triggered; winning the bet cuts the Boss’s health in half, and losing restores the Boss’s health to 1/3. Players can choose gambling or not.

The game difficulty is adjustable, allowing players to select a health cap (1-3 points) to control the level of challenge. Additionally, the difference in difficulty between levels is mainly reflected in the amount of enemies and different mechanisms, including:
1.	Time travelling: Change the scene and item layout with different time, triggered by switchs;
2.	Gravity system: Players can control gravity, moving on the ceiling rather than the ground;
3.	Growing and shrinking: After eating a specific item, the character can shrink to access areas that are normally unreachable.

Optional:
- On tops of jumping, players can also attack;
- Player profile can be saved and shared externally;
- Alter the character's appearance depending on the skills they currently use.

Game Idea 2：
### Majhontro（Balatro Based）
Core Mechanics: Card Construction and Combination

**Deck Building:**
Players build their deck by selecting different cards. Each card has unique effects or attributes, such as scoring points, triggering special effects, or reducing the number of cards in hand.

**Card Types:**
 Cards are generally divided into the following categories:
- Normal Cards: Used for direct scoring or forming combinations.
- Skill Cards: Feature special effects like modifying the hand, removing specific cards, or increasing combination multipliers.
Special Cards: Based on "Red Zhong" (or other themed cards), each with different effects, such as adding extra points or unique abilities.

**Card Features:**
Some cards have "chain reaction" abilities, which trigger additional card effects when played. Players must strategically combine cards to achieve higher scores or more efficient actions in each turn.
________________________________________
Core Objective: Scoring Strategy

**Objective:**
Players must score points by utilizing cards, aiming to achieve the highest total score to complete each level.

**Scoring Mechanism：**
Each card may provide direct points or require combinations with other cards to maximize value:
- Some cards grant bonus points for specific hand combinations.
- Certain cards require fulfilling specific conditions to unlock high-score rewards.
- Negative Effect Management: 
The game includes cards with negative effects, such as deducting points, restricting actions, or imposing specific limitations (e.g., limiting the number of cards that can be played or discarded, or banning certain combinations). Players need to plan to mitigate these impacts carefully.
________________________________________

**Roguelike Elements: Dynamic Construction and Decisions**
- Dynamic Deck Evolution:
After each round, players can acquire new cards or remove old ones, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in their deck.
-	Random Events:
Random events occur during the game, offering rewards (e.g., bonus points, card upgrades) or challenges (e.g., adding negative cards, reducing resources).
-	Increasing Difficulty:
As levels progress, the game's difficulty increases. Players face tougher challenges, such as higher score requirements and more complex negative effects.
________________________________________

**Resource Management and Achievements**
-	Resource Management:
After completing each level, players earn coins. These coins can be used to purchase buffs or special cards to enhance their deck.
- Achievements:
Players can unlock achievements by meeting specific criteria, such as completing a certain number of levels, achieving a high score in a single round, or using specific combinations of cards. Achievements reward players with new special cards or other benefits.
________________________________________

**Level Design and Challenges**
Levels are grouped into sets of four, with the final level in each set being a boss level:
-	Level Objectives:
Each level requires players to reach a target score to proceed.
-	Boss Battles:
Boss levels introduce restrictions on card playing or drawing, adding a unique layer of challenge.
________________________________________

**Core Fun Factors**
-	Strategic Depth:
Players must evaluate various card combinations and choose the optimal strategy to maximize their score in each turn.
-	Randomness and Replayability:
Random events and dynamic card generation ensure a unique experience in every playthrough, enhancing replay value.
-	Sense of Growth:
Through card upgrades and strategic adjustments, players can tangibly feel their progress and improvement in the game.


#### Game Innovation Based on Chinese Mahjong Elements 

**Mahjong Tile Substitution:**
-	Each card in the original game can be replaced with a Mahjong tile, including number tiles (Bamboo, Characters, and Dots) and honor tiles (East, South, West, North, Red Dragon, Green Dragon, and White Dragon).
-	Mahjong tiles naturally have "combinations," such as sequences (e.g., 1-2-3 in the same suit), triplets (three identical tiles), and quads (four identical tiles), which can be used as scoring conditions.
-	Replacing Suit Logic:
-The suits of cards (e.g., Hearts, Spades) are replaced by Mahjong tile categories (Bamboo, Characters, and Dots), while honor tiles gain unique effects.
________________________________________

**Scoring Rules**
**__Basic Scoring Rules__**
-	Players start with 14 tiles and have two opportunities to play, along with up to three discards in each round. Scoring is based on combinations formed: 
1.	Sequences: For example, 1 Dot, 2 Dot, 3 Dot, earns basic points.
2.	Triplets: For example, three identical 5 Characters tiles yield higher points.
3.	Quads: Forming four identical tiles grants bonus rewards.

__Special Tile Combinations for Bonus Points:__
-	Introduce classic Mahjong hands as high-scoring combinations: 
1.	Pure Suit (清一色): All tiles belong to the same suit (e.g., all Bamboo).
2.	Mixed Suit with Honors (混一色): A mix of one tile category and honor tiles.
3.  Seven Pairs (七对): Seven pairs of tiles.
-	Negative Effects:
o	If players have "orphan tiles" (tiles that cannot be combined), they incur penalties, similar to negative cards in the original game.

________________________________________
**Turn-Based Gameplay**
**__Player Actions per Turn:__**
Players can choose one of the following actions each turn:
1.	Draw Tiles: Randomly draw tiles from the "tile wall" to replenish their hand.
2.	Discard Tiles: Remove useless tiles from their hand to optimize future moves.
3.	Form Combinations: Use tiles to create valid sets (e.g., sequences, triplets) and score points.
__Special Tile Effects:__
1.	Certain honor tiles trigger unique effects: 
2.  Fortune (发财): Doubles the score for the current round.
3.  White Board (白板): Acts as a wildcard and can substitute for any tile.
________________________________________

**Summary**
This redesigned game integrates Mahjong’s traditional mechanics into the core gameplay, replacing card-based logic with Mahjong tiles. By incorporating Mahjong’s rich combination rules and unique tile effects, the game gains a deeper strategic layer and retains the cultural essence of Mahjong, while maintaining the turn-based structure and scoring strategy from the original design.
